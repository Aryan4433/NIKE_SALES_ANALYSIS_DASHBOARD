# NIKE_SALES_ANALYSIS_DASHBOARD_USING_MS_EXCEL


Hello Connections😊

I'm thrilled to share my latest portfolio project – the Nike Sales Analysis Dashboard created using Excel! This project was a labor of love, and it's a powerful tool for tracking and visualizing sales data for Nike products. 📈💼

The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into Nike's sales performance, offering data on revenue, units sold, and profitability over time. With interactive charts and graphs, users can easily spot trends and make data-driven decisions. 📊📉

I put a lot of effort into making this dashboard visually appealing and user-friendly, with a focus on delivering valuable insights. It's not just about data; it's about making data work for you! 📊

Feel free to check out my project and let me know your thoughts. Your feedback and support mean the world to me. 🙌👨‍💻
